                        <p>Lupus is a chronic (long-term) disease that 
                            can cause inflammation and pain in any part of your body. 
                            It’s an autoimmune disease, which means that your immune system — 
                            the body system that usually fights infections — attacks healthy 
                            tissue instead.</p>
                            <p>Lupus most commonly affects your skin, joints and internal organs, like your kidneys and heart.</p>
                            <p>Because lupus affects many parts of the body, it can cause a lot of different symptoms.</p>

                        <p>Our mission id to end the brutal impact of lupus, and 
                            raising awareness of the devastation that this disease 
                            can cause is incredibly important. We urge everybody to 
                            Make Lupus Visible this May by wearing purple, sharing 
                            facts about lupus, and raising funds for the critical research and support programs that our community relies on.</p>

                            <p>Lupus affects an estimated 1.5 million people in the U.S. alone, and awareness of how devastating this disease is 
                            remains low and misunderstood. That’s why raising awareness, funds and making lupus visible is so crucial this May for Lupus Awareness Month. 
                            Even though many of us are physically apart due to the coronavirus, there are still several ways we can come together to Make Lupus Visible.</p>
